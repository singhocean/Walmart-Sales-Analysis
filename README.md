## Steps taken for analysis
### 1. Data Wrangling:
Did inspection of data to make sure **NULL** values and missing values are detected. 

### 2. Build a Database.
### 3. Create a table and insert data.
There are no null values in our database as while creating the tables each field was set to **NOT NULL** and hence null values got filtered out.

### 4. Added some new columns from existing ones.
1. Add a new column named **'time_of_day'** to give insight of sales in the Morning, Afternoon and Evening. This helped answering questions like on which part of the day most sales are made.
2. Add a new column named **'day_name'** that contains the extracted days of the week on which the given transaction took place (Mon, Tue, Wed, Thur, Fri). This helped answering questions like on which weekday each branch was mostly busy.
3. Add a new column named **'month_name'** that contains the extracted months of the year on which the given transaction took place (Jan, Feb, Mar). Helped to determine which month of the year had the most sales and profit.

### 5. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Exploratory data analysis done to answer the Business questions listed in the Business Questions topic above. All the SQL queries written to answer those questions are in the **'WalmartQueries.sql'** file.
